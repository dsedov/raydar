Implement Multi-level Ray Tracing:
Use a coarser grid for initial ray traversal and then refine the search in potentially hit areas.
Optimize the ray_color function:
This function is called frequently and can be optimized. Consider inlining some operations and reducing function calls.
Use Thread-Local Storage:
For multi-threaded rendering, use thread-local storage for frequently accessed data to reduce cache coherency issues.
11. Implement a Tiled Rendering Approach:
Divide the image into tiles and render each tile independently. This can improve cache utilization.
