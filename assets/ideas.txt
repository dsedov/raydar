To make your ray tracing code even faster, you can implement several optimizations. Here are some suggestions:
SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) Operations:
Implement SIMD instructions to perform operations on multiple data points simultaneously. This is particularly useful for vector operations in ray tracing.
Packet Tracing:
Instead of tracing one ray at a time, trace a packet of rays (e.g., 4 or 8) simultaneously. This can better utilize SIMD instructions and improve cache coherency.
Optimize BVH (Bounding Volume Hierarchy):
Your current BVH implementation can be improved. Consider implementing a SAH (Surface Area Heuristic) for better BVH construction. Also, optimize the BVH traversal algorithm.
Vectorization:
Use compiler auto-vectorization or explicit vectorization directives to optimize loops. You can use OpenMP SIMD directives or Intel ISPC for more explicit control.
Memory Optimization:
Ensure your data structures are cache-friendly. Use Structures of Arrays (SoA) instead of Arrays of Structures (AoS) where appropriate.
Avoid Branches:
Replace conditional statements with branchless operations where possible, especially in frequently executed code paths.
Use Fast Math:
Enable fast math compiler options for faster floating-point operations at the cost of some precision.
Implement Multi-level Ray Tracing:
Use a coarser grid for initial ray traversal and then refine the search in potentially hit areas.
Optimize the ray_color function:
This function is called frequently and can be optimized. Consider inlining some operations and reducing function calls.
Use Thread-Local Storage:
For multi-threaded rendering, use thread-local storage for frequently accessed data to reduce cache coherency issues.
11. Implement a Tiled Rendering Approach:
Divide the image into tiles and render each tile independently. This can improve cache utilization.
